There's nothing quite like watching a movie outside in your own backyard. Bringing you blankets and pillows hanging around with your family together enjoy the summer night.

It will be even better if you can stream the video from the Internet and streams it smoothly. With a strong WiFi signal in your backyard, you can wireless stream video on your cell phone and cast to the big screen with a projector.

WiFi for your backyard
----------------------

An EAP outdoor access point can provide a reliable signal for your video. The EAP access point comes with two 360Â°  omni-directional antennas which can cover 100 meters (300 feet) radius outdoor area which is good for most of our backyards.
