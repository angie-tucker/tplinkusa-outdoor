The most obvious solution to backyard Wi-Fi is adding an access point (EAP) or customer premises equipment that can fuction as an access point or bridge (CPE). An EAP comes with two 360°  omni-directional antennas which can cover a 100 meter (300 feet) radius outdoor area.

The CPE access point has more focused wireless beam width and better sensitivity for the wireless connection.

The EAP has a dual band model which can service 2.4GHz and 5GHz at the same time. CPEs work in a single band, 2.4GHz or 5GHz, for focused clients. If you do have a focused client area, CPE will be a good choice for you. Otherwise, EAP will be a good choice.

Both CPE and EAP come with weather-proof housing and are resistant to dust and moisture. The PoE injector is included with the product to supply power and data on the same wire allowing for flexible remote installations outdoors.
    
Installation
------------

* Reference :doc:`/how_to/cpe_onboarding` or  :doc:`/how_to/eap_onboarding` for detail instructions on access point set up.
* Remember to use a shielded Ethernet cable to connect to the access point and ground the PoE injector properly to provide the best lighting protection.
