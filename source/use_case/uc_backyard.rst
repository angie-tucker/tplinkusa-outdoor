The most obvious solution to a backyard Wifi is adding up an EAP or CPE. An EAP comes with two 360°  omni-directional antennas which can cover 100 meters (300 feet) radius outdoor area.

The CPE access point has more focused wireless beam width and better sensitivity for the wireless connection.

The EAP has a dual band model which can service 2.4GHz and 5GHz at the same time. CPEs work in a single band, 2.4GHz or 5GHz, for focused clients. If you do have a focused client area, CPE will be a good choice to you. Otherwise, EAP will be a good choice.

Both CPE and EAP come with weather proof housing resisting the dust and moisture. The PoE injector comes with the product supply the power and data on the same wire remotely allowing the flexible installation in the outdoor area.
    
Installation
------------

* Reference :doc:`/how_to/cpe_onboarding` or  :doc:`/how_to/eap_onboarding` for detail instructions on access point set up.
* Remember using a shielded Ethernet cable to connect to the access point and ground the PoE injector proper to provide the best lighting protection.
