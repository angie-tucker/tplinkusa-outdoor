Outdoor Wireless Example : - High school football field
=======================================================

In this example, a customer wants to update the content display on a highway billboard. The control PC is sitting in a nearby building. There is a small hill along the highway between the building and the billboard. The customer wants to know how high the CPE should be installed.

Determine the height of the installation
----------------------------------------

In the `how to calculate the wireless range`_ we have explained the details of the radio transmission as well as the Fresnel zone. The most ebay number you can get is the distance from the building to the top of the hill and from top of the hill to the billboard. Visit the Google map with the computer. Right click and then choose the **measure** to get the numbers.

It is relatively hard to decide the ground level of the building and the billboard, or the relative heights on the top of the billboard, hill top, and roof top of the building. A sight scope with a level can be very helpful to determine the heights of these objects.

From the customer's description, the distance from the building to the hilltop is 280 meters. The distance from the hill top to the billboard is 45 meters. The hilltop is 6.6 meters higher than the ground level of the billboard. With the Fresnel zone formula, we can find the center line between two CPEs should be at least 4.8 meters higher than the hilltop.

Installation
------------

Customer installed the CPE on the building as an access point and the one on the billboard as a client at the estimated height. The average throughput in this installation was measured 87 Mbps in average.
