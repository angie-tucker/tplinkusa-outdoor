Powerline communication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you build your backyard office or summer house lately, you probably will bury a data wire with the powerline from your main house to the isolated shed. If you do have a powerline to the shed and no data wire, there is another chance to extend your network easily using the buried powerline.

Using the powerline for data communication, you need to find the direct connect electric loop connecting your home and the shed. Most of the time, the powerline will be isolated by the circuit bracker of the main house and the shed. Therefor, there are at least 2 circuit breaker to jump over. If you can find the power outlet right next to the circuit breaker, that will be the best location to install the powerline adapter. The data transmission rate will be vary to the different powerline.

.. note:: 
   The powerline communication cannot cross over the GFCI circuit breaker. If you do have GFCI circuit breaker on either one of the panel, please use another way to extend your Internet.
